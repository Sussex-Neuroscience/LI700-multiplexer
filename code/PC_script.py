"""Licor serial comm is done with 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (9600 N 8 1) configured as a DTE device
- XOFF (0x13) indicates full input buffer
- XON (0x11) when input buffer is free again
commands ARE case sensitive
commands start with "(" and must end with ")"
line feed character (decimal 10 <lf>) must follow commmands send to the analyzer

"""
One experimental pipeline for testing the software:  

Cell A which is sample  
Cell B is control  
  
1- Calibration (so that A is zero) water  
2- Make A and B equal water  
3- Calibration (so that A is zero) co2  
4- Make A and B equal co2  
5- Start recording (two samples per second â€“ give users an option)  
6- Open chamber, put animal in, close chamber  
7- If movement is being tracked, start timer with to synch recording to chamber measurements  
8- Recordings last 30 min  
  
Each sample should contain  
Licor temperature, co2, water for both chambers (check getting the difference from both chambers as well, or calculated via software afterwards)
